## [1.0.0] - 2018-01-26

### Changed

- Settings are now used with a shorter lower case format and thus separated from the constants.

## [0.3.0] - 2018-01-26

### Changed

- Code documentation updates and fixes.
- All plugin data including the plugin version is loaded automatically from the plugin file comments and stored into plugin settings.
- Errors are back under the Post class. Other classes may access the errors via an object reference of the Post class.
- The `Polylang` class uses `Api::get_prop()` for `i18n` data handling to prevent errors.
- Fixed the `master` property handling in the `Polylang` class to match the original specification.

### Added

- If `_thumbnail_id` is trying to be saved before attachments are saved, an error is produced and the meta key-value pair is not saved.
- If the Post object contains time information, add them into the post data array in `wp_insert_post_data` hook to save them into the database.
- A custom database table that stores all the imports made.
- If errors are found, revert the current post to the last successful import. If it is the first import, set post status as `draft`.
- Added a `force_save` flag for the `save()` functions. This forces saving even if the importer object has errors.
